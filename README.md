My work on the Unity Platformer Game

***    1 - Random checkpoints, random players    ***

        4 different characters belonging to 4 different maps.
        When the character is defeated on the map it is on, it is spawned on a random map and the character of that map.

        - The last checkpoint the character passed through, starts from the equivalent checkpoint in other maps.
        - Old checkpoints are disabled.
        - Character cannot spawn on the same map when defeated.
